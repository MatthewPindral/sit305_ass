- Not enough commits + changelog items to pass at this frequency.
- I couldn't find your text-based data. Create a root folder "data/" and put all your JSON files in there.
- You're still missing a licenses.txt + changelog.md file.

# Henry comments 17/April
- I'm still waiting on that changelog file :)

# Henry comments 27/April
- Good to see some progress, especially data
- This file still needs compile instructions, and directory explanation so I know where to find stuff.
- Your changelog needs a lot of work. And it also needs to be placed in the root directory here.
